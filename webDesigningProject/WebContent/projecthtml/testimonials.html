                During 17-19th Feb, The Singha Corporation held the company's annual conference at Hello Hotel. 
                This is one of our most important event where numerous VIP attended including the board of directors. 
                Their team did an outstanding job.
                On behalf of Singha Corporation I would like to express my gratitude to the Hello Hotel.

                Thank you so much to the Hello Hotel. I left something behind at the hotel and also wanted them to issue another receipt for tax purposes.
                They immediately worked on it and the receipt was sent in the hour by email. The item was returned within the day. 
                Totally beyond my expectation. 
                You can totally trust this hotel!
